# Project of algorithm and data structures(Lorenzo Galatea)

### _INTRODUCTION_:
Description of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/LorenzoGalatea/PROVA-FINALE-PROGETTO-DI-ALGORITMI-E-STRUTTURE-DATI-/blob/86cdcb8b0fd9d2b43c5ef6ea71dbfa5e4a77b4bd/project%20specifications/2022_2023.pdf)
This project has been developed as part of the "Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica" course at Politecnico di Milano(2022-2023). It has been evaluated "30/30".


### _GOALS_:
The goal of this project was to develop a highly optimized program. It needed to be as fast as possible and consume less memory as possible.
For this reason, a variant of the dijkstra algorithm was developed and adapted to the context. The structures used are different: a min heap and a binary search tree.
For further information and tests, the program code is [here](https://github.com/LorenzoGalatea/PROVA-FINALE-PROGETTO-DI-ALGORITMI-E-STRUTTURE-DATI-/blob/a6047f1607381273d314a8dfa3584c98f1658908/Main(programma).c)
The testing platform was divided in public and private tests. Some of the public tests public tests can be found [here](https://github.com/LorenzoGalatea/PROVA-FINALE-PROGETTO-DI-ALGORITMI-E-STRUTTURE-DATI-/tree/86cdcb8b0fd9d2b43c5ef6ea71dbfa5e4a77b4bd/project%20specifications/test%20archive)
